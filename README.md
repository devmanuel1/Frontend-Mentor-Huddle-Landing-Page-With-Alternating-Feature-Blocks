## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my very first project on Frontend Mentor. I learned how to use different flexbox properties to align items along both the main and the cross axis. I also learnt firsthand how Responsive Web Design works.

### Continued development

I plan to build more Frontend Mentor projects to help me sharpen my HTML & CSS skills, and when I am confident, I will move over to projects that include JavaScript.
